# Mito Vue Bootcamp

Hello, and welcome!

Let's get into something new. First, run `npm install` to have your dependencies installed, then run `npm run dev` to start playing around.

This is the 1.0 version, and we have a few things to do:

- [ ] Get familiar with the anatomy of the app
- [ ] Refactor `App.vue` to have some child component

## And our goal is to have:
- [ ] Well-separated component structure
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] State management
- [ ] Localization
- [ ] Handling forms
